                      left/right or backwards/forwards. You are probably more familiar with these than you think. If you've ever played a video game and ran around a 
                      building, an alien planet or a football field then you're in a 3D environment.

                      Some applications are ideally suited to a 3D environment, such as visualising complex 3D structures or exploring an outdoor space for example.
                      However, we also believe that traditional 2D data may benefit from being situated in a 3D world. See the data visualisation FAQ below and refer to 
                      the <a href="https://www.drt-software.com/drtBlog" class="linkOrange" target="_blank">blog</a> for a more in-depth explanation.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Yes. It used to be the case that to interact with any type of 3D world you had to use a high-end PC or a games console. This is no longer 
                      the case. Complex 3D environments can be viewed in a web browser and on mobile devices.

                    <p class="card-text">The visualisation or representation of data in graphical form. We are typically used to seeing such data presented as
                      graphs, bar charts or infographics. While these work adequately we try and give a more interactive experience by utilising 3D environments.

                      Predominantly, yes. We believe that 3D offers significant benefits over a 2D counterpart. For a more detailed discussion on the benefits

                    <p class="card-text">
                      It is an ideal mechanism for visualising three-dimensional structures and data with multiple dimensions, such as time-varying data for example.
                      It also offers greater utilisation of the space, with an associated increase in clarity. This may well help to spot any emerging trends, which may also 
                      provide financial benefits. For a full discussion, check out the <a href="https://www.drt-software.com/drtBlog" class="linkOrange" target="_blank">blog</a>.

                      No, not at all! If you already have some idea of how you'd like to see your data then that's great, but if not then we will discuss all your 
                      requirements and design a visualisation that matches your needs.

                      Of course! They are great pieces of software, but they are predominantly designed to create dashboards that represent 2D data. Ultimately it
                      depends on the complexity of your data and a 2D representation may suffice, but if your data is slightly more complicated then it may well be that
                      a 3D environment is the best fit.

                      blasting alien hordes. Typically, virtual reality is used to refer to experiences that use technology such as head-mounted displays but 
                      any experience that is situated in a virtual world may be said to be virtual reality. 
                      Application areas are wide and diverse, ranging from entertainment to medical applications and training scenarios.

                    <p class="card-text">No, not at all. You can experience VR by playing a game on a mobile device. More costly solutions are also available, utilising 
                      head-mounted displays to track your head movements, handheld controllers for interaction and haptic feedback devices to generate a sense of touch.

                      Lower-end devices can use mobile phones that slot into a headset. More costly systems offer high-resolution displays and wireless headsets
                       (there are no cables to trip you up as you move about). We have experience of such systems and would be willing to recommend a solution to fit
                       your needs.

                    <p class="card-text">It is possible, yes. As you move your head around, the viewpoint may not quite update as quickly as you can move. This may sometimes 
                      lead to a feeling of motion sickness. This may also happen if the scene is moving without your control - such as a roller coaster for example.
                      Modern hardware with quick response times and a high-resolution display, combined with a well-designed application, can go some way to alleviating this 
                      (if that is the desired effect!).

                    <p class="card-text">Imagine that you have a complex manual operation to perform or a hazardous procedure that you need to practice safely without 
                      endangering people. Virtual reality allows you to create scenarios where you can train people to perform such tasks without fear of doing it 
                      incorrectly or mistakes being dangerous. You can practice as often as you like and receive all the relevant training until you are proficient. The 
                      financial benefits may be considerable, as the whole procedure is simulated thereby saving on costly equipment or materials.

                    <p class="card-text">This is the addition ("augmenting") of information or content onto a real-world experience. For example, you may point your 
                      mobile device at a historical building and it may display relevant information, such as its age, who lived there, what they were famous for, etc. 
                      The information is seamlessly integrated into the view. Applications include virtual exhibitions, games, medical procedures, architecture and many more.

                    <p class="card-text">Earlier AR systems used markers to detect where a virtual object should be placed in the environment. Each marker is associated
                      with differing content. This process relies on image processing software to detect each marker. More sophisticated systems use image processing to
                      determine other characteristics, such as a flat surface, and place the virtual content accordingly. AR systems may also use geographical location to 
                      identify places of interest in the surrounding environment and add appropriate information, such as historical details or directions to a 
                      nearby landmark.

                    <p class="card-text">Not at all. Although there have been specialist devices designed to present augmented information such as AR glasses or heads-up displays,
                       AR is capable of working in a web browser without additional software, it relies on the device camera (or webcam) to operate. There are also 
                       AR applications that may be used on mobile devices.

            The conventional view of data visualisation consists of graphs, bar charts, histograms and varied types of infographics, etc.
            Whilst these methods can portray trends or give meaning to the data, we believe that there are more effective ways to
            visualise things.
         </p>
  
         <p>
          Here you can see data that you would normally expect to see represented as a bar chart or something similar is represented as a collection of 3D bar charts.
          So why is this better?
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
              You now have more space to play with. Your data can sit apart from other items of information, making it more clear and readable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The extra dimension. Some data lends itself to being displayed in three dimensions, such as time-varying data. Combined with the added space, you
              can now see how your data gas evolved over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Viewing the data. Your data now exists in a 3D world. You can view it from differing angles, potentially making it easier to see and spot trends.
              You can place the data in more intuitive ways, also helping to decipher or spot trends.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interaction. Typically 3D environments offer more interaction than their 2D counterparts (that's not to say you can't interact with a 2D visualisation).
              You can highlight, scale, filter and process the data. Show trends or values within it or rearrange the items. You can show more data at any one time 
              without cluttering the space. Moving through the data is typically easier, as it's all shown in the same context.
            </li>
            <p>
              We can show years of monthly data for example and fit a surface to all of it to show all trends - do that in excel!
            </p>
            <p>
              Does not apply to static 3d vis - this can be very confusing - it has to be interactive
            </p>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          What about power bi and tableau, etc.
